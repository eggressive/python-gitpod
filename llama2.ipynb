      "  Of course, I'd be happy to help you write a birthday card for your dear friend Andrew! Here are a few suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Personalized Message: Start by writing a personalized message that speaks to your friendship with Andrew. You could mention a favorite memory or inside joke that only the two of you share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to my favorite friend, Andrew! I can't believe it's been [X] years since we met. You've been there for me through thick and thin, and I'm so grateful for your friendship. Here's to another year of adventures and good times together! üéâ\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Funny Quote: If you want to add a bit of humor to your card, consider using a funny quote that relates to Andrew's personality or interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the most awesome Andrew in the world! May your day be as epic as your beard and your love for [insert hobby or interest here] üòÇ\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Heartfelt Words: If you want to express your feelings in a more heartfelt way, try writing a message that speaks to the importance of Andrew in your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andrew, you're more than just a friend to me. You're a constant source of support, laughter, and inspiration. I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings for you. Happy birthday, my dear friend! ‚ù§Ô∏è\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inside Joke: If you and Andrew share a special inside joke or reference, consider including it in your card. It will make the message more personal and meaningful to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the only person I know who can make me laugh as hard as I did when we [insert inside joke here]! I hope your day is as amazing as you are, Andrew. üòÇ\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the most important thing is to be sincere and genuine in your message. Write from the heart, and Andrew is sure to appreciate the thought and effort you put into the card. Happy birthday, Andrew! üéâ\n"
